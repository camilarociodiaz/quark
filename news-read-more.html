                            The multi-channel Quark.ai platform combines Deep Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision to interpret complex customer cases and automatically provide resolutions with high accuracy and speed, resulting in higher Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) and significantly lower support costs.  Quark.ai’s unique IP enables the platform to be deployed at High-Tech companies with no additional training for its Deep Learning models, enabling customers to realize ROI in a matter of months. Quark.ai resolutions eliminate hours of document reviews by support engineers and can also be used for “auto-response.”  Auto-response is a process in which Quark.ai automatically responds to a case or takes corrective actions, for resolutions in which it has very high confidence. Quark.ai can deliver an increase in support productivity of over 40%.

                         Quark.ai’s app enables automation of a customer support process for High Tech and Industrial products that today can be expensive, inefficient and manual. When the customer submits a case in Salesforce, Quark.ai is triggered automatically, which interprets the support case and pulls up resolutions from existing reference documents. When a resolution has a high confidence score, Quark.ai automatically responds to the customer via Auto Response or takes corrective action (Auto Action) based on the content of the resolution. Even if 10 – 20% of support cases are handled with Auto Response, it represents savings to the company, as well as reduction in the overall response time.

                            <b> San Jose, CA. July 06, 2021 – </b> Quark.ai today announced the listing of its Quark.ai Autonomous Customer Support app in the Zendesk Marketplace https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/quarkai-assistant/. The Quark.ai app now offers Zendesk’s more than 100,000 global customers the ability to interpret complex customer cases and automatically provide customer support resolutions with unrivaled accuracy and speed. 
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Quark.ai, which consistently delivers higher Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) and lower support costs, generate ROI in months for High-Tech and Industrial companies. Quark.ai’s Deep Learning platform, which needs no additional training and can also be used for auto-response, eliminates hours of document research that typically takes up half the time of customer support engineers.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Quark.ai automates customer support functions that are typically expensive, inefficient, and manual. The submission of a customer support case automatically triggers Quark.ai, which interprets the support case and extracts resolutions from existing reference documents. When a resolution has a high confidence score, Quark.ai automatically responds to the customer via Auto-Response or takes corrective action (Auto Action) based on the content of the resolution. If even 10 – 20% of support cases are handled with Auto Response, it represents substantial savings to the company in terms of monetary expense and response time. Add to that a typical 25% increase in support engineer productivity, and the overall Customer Support performance improvement for companies can exceed 40%.

                        “We are extremely pleased to bring Quark.ai Autonomous Customer Support to the Zendesk Marketplace,” said Prosenjit Sen, Quark.ai’s Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “Quark.ai’s rapid onboarding and minimal need for training mean that Zendesk Marketplace customers can quickly begin to achieve the efficiencies that Autonomous Customer Support provides.”

                            For business owners with a solid user base, the ability to communicate and solve problems for those customers is a necessary part of the growth process. Quark.ai is a tech startup making that part of the business easier with its autonomous customer support platform built for accuracy. The company recently announced the closing of a seed-plus funding round to expand its technology and scale up to meet new demand.
                        </p>
                       
<h2> How Quark.ai Works and Effectiveness of Platform</h2>
                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Tech startup Quark.ai uses deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to create highly accurate, automatic responses to customer emails and address any problems. What sets the company apart from similar ones is its recognition capabilities. For similar questions, the tech startup can identify the root of the questions asked and provides direct responses without the need for human interference or reference. Additionally, it can easily recognize duplicate emails and respond to one instead of both.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            For business owners, Quark.ai can be very effective for multiple reasons. In comparison to hiring a human who exclusively handles customer support, the company is a significantly cheaper alternative. Alongside being more efficient, the tech startup has been proven to be more efficient with its deep learning software only improving over time. 
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            One of the most important features that the company offers is document reading and processing. A business owner can essentially feed the deep learning software any documents or guides that relate to customer support or products being sold, and it will gain all relevant information to better respond to customers. 
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            The effectiveness of the software created by the tech startup has made it very popular with business owners looking to save money and increase productivity. Furthermore, many investors see the company as a major opportunity for future growth.
                        </p>
                      

                        <h2> Quark.ai Funding and Future Plans </h2>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            In a seed-plus funding round for Quark.ai, the business raised over $5 million. The funding round was led by DNX Ventures with participation from Fusion Fund, Tie Angels, and True Blue Partners. 
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            The company will use this new funding to help expand and improve the current technology used by the business. The technology will be scaled up to handle larger clients and more complex tasks. Additionally, the tech startup will look to grow its business by onboarding more customers. Earlier this month, the company was listed on the Zendesk marketplace to open itself to a larger audience. 
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Quark.ai is also gaining more momentum just as customer service sees its value rising exponentially. In fact, the customer service industry is worth well over $350 billion. That value is only expected to grow as more businesses begin to create an online presence for themselves. 
                        </p>

                            When commenting on the latest funding round for Quark.ai, DNX Ventures Managing Partner Q Motiwala said, “Quark.ai has already demonstrated unprecedented customer experience and efficiency to resolve complex support cases. We look forward to helping Quark.ai bring the power of the Autonomous Customer Support platform to enterprise customers throughout the world.”

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Quark.ai, the market leader in Autonomous Customer Support, today announced the introduction of its Autonomous Customer Support Chatbot, “Cory,” developed specifically to enable instant self-service resolutions for complex technical issues confronting industrial and technology enterprises.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                            Quark.ai’s interpretive and conversational chatbot delivers unsurpassed accuracy, reliability and speed-to-resolution for some of industry’s most mission-critical customer issues. The chatbot is an extension of Quark.ai’s Autonomous Customer Support platform, which combines Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to automate research-intensive functions that are often manual, expensive and frustratingly inefficient. Quark.ai promptly interprets complex Customer Support cases, scours an enterprise’s internal documents and delivers instant resolutions to customers. The result for Customer Support Organizations is significant improvement in Customer Satisfaction and support expense.

                        <br>
                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Existing Chatbots require pre-built rules and responses that address a narrowly defined set of inquiries, and thus are unable to handle the wide variety of issues that frequently confront technical support. Unlike these existing designs, Quark.ai’s Autonomous Chatbot is capable of having a conversation with the customer to resolve any issue or inquiry, without prior construction of the response. Quark.ai accomplishes this by using its proprietary NLP technology to clearly understand and cross-examine an inquiry, regardless of its complexity.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Quark.ai’s patented combination of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing produces a chatbot with the ability to ask-and-answer in more natural words, phrases and terminology maintains a more comfortable, insight-inducing conversation with a customer. This unrivaled solution considers, analyzes and contextualizes the different words that comprise the inquiry and applies that understanding to a resolution of the issue. It is capable of using all available documents within the organization to automatically and intelligently prepare responses and resolutions This unsurpassed capability is especially critical to customers of industrial and technology companies, whose complex products often have numerous versions and continual updates.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            “Quark.ai’s conversational chatbot fulfills the vision of self-service in customer support,” said Quark.ai Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Prosenjit Sen. “Nearly all inquiring customers who begin with self-service quickly abandon it in frustration and demand to interact with a customer support representative. This leads to a poor customer experience – and a sub-optimal resolution to the customer’s issue. Quark.ai’s conversational chatbot is a long-awaited solution to this pain point, injecting the accuracy, speed and comprehensiveness of Autonomous Customer Support to the front lines of customer interaction.”

                            <b> San Jose, CA, October 31, 2022 </b> – Quark.ai, the Autonomous Support Platform for Technical/Field Support and B2B e-Commerce, today introduced the Quark.ai Workflow Automator, a powerful module designed to power Field Support engineers with a self-service tool for rapidly resolving complex support-related workflow issues of industrial enterprises.

                            The Quark.ai Workflow Automator module enables unparalleled productivity improvement. A robust combination of Deep Learning, NLP and Computer Vision, it allows Field Support engineers to quickly and accurately troubleshoot issues in real time – whether at the customer’s site or remotely — with step-by-step instructions to help them identify and resolve complex issues. While troubleshooting, they can also ask Quark.ai detailed questions in natural English to see relevant sections of reference documents that have the answers. If Field Support engineers need help, they can also receive guidance from a back-office support staff who is also powered with Quark.ai’s tool.

                            “AI based workflows are critical for field support in telecommunication, heavy machinery, instrumentation and other industrial companies,” said Prosenjit Sen, Co-Founder and CEO of Quark.ai. “The Quark.ai Autonomous Support platform can optimize the resolution of customer issues by utilizing the Workflow Automator in combination with its companion Similar Tickets module. While companies often need to help Field Support engineers on-site, they frequently waste money by dispatching them when the issue doesn’t require it. Companies can solve this problem by additionally utilizing the Quark.ai Similar Tickets module, which can quickly identify other similar tickets from its historical tickets database. The Similar Tickets module illustrates previous actions taken in response to similar issues, enabling the company to maximize accuracy, speed and efficiency in resolving the new issue.”
