                            The multi-channel Quark.ai platform combines Deep Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision to interpret complex customer cases and automatically provide resolutions with high accuracy and speed, resulting in higher Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) and significantly lower support costs.  Quark.ai’s unique IP enables the platform to be deployed at High-Tech companies with no additional training for its Deep Learning models, enabling customers to realize ROI in a matter of months. Quark.ai resolutions eliminate hours of document reviews by support engineers and can also be used for “auto-response.”  Auto-response is a process in which Quark.ai automatically responds to a case or takes corrective actions, for resolutions in which it has very high confidence. Quark.ai can deliver an increase in support productivity of over 40%.

                         Quark.ai’s app enables automation of a customer support process for High Tech and Industrial products that today can be expensive, inefficient and manual. When the customer submits a case in Salesforce, Quark.ai is triggered automatically, which interprets the support case and pulls up resolutions from existing reference documents. When a resolution has a high confidence score, Quark.ai automatically responds to the customer via Auto Response or takes corrective action (Auto Action) based on the content of the resolution. Even if 10 – 20% of support cases are handled with Auto Response, it represents savings to the company, as well as reduction in the overall response time.

                            <b> San Jose, CA. July 06, 2021 – </b> Quark.ai today announced the listing of its Quark.ai Autonomous Customer Support app in the Zendesk Marketplace https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/quarkai-assistant/. The Quark.ai app now offers Zendesk’s more than 100,000 global customers the ability to interpret complex customer cases and automatically provide customer support resolutions with unrivaled accuracy and speed. 
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Quark.ai, which consistently delivers higher Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) and lower support costs, generate ROI in months for High-Tech and Industrial companies. Quark.ai’s Deep Learning platform, which needs no additional training and can also be used for auto-response, eliminates hours of document research that typically takes up half the time of customer support engineers.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Quark.ai automates customer support functions that are typically expensive, inefficient, and manual. The submission of a customer support case automatically triggers Quark.ai, which interprets the support case and extracts resolutions from existing reference documents. When a resolution has a high confidence score, Quark.ai automatically responds to the customer via Auto-Response or takes corrective action (Auto Action) based on the content of the resolution. If even 10 – 20% of support cases are handled with Auto Response, it represents substantial savings to the company in terms of monetary expense and response time. Add to that a typical 25% increase in support engineer productivity, and the overall Customer Support performance improvement for companies can exceed 40%.

                        “We are extremely pleased to bring Quark.ai Autonomous Customer Support to the Zendesk Marketplace,” said Prosenjit Sen, Quark.ai’s Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “Quark.ai’s rapid onboarding and minimal need for training mean that Zendesk Marketplace customers can quickly begin to achieve the efficiencies that Autonomous Customer Support provides.”

                            For business owners with a solid user base, the ability to communicate and solve problems for those customers is a necessary part of the growth process. Quark.ai is a tech startup making that part of the business easier with its autonomous customer support platform built for accuracy. The company recently announced the closing of a seed-plus funding round to expand its technology and scale up to meet new demand.
                        </p>
                       
<h2> How Quark.ai Works and Effectiveness of Platform</h2>
                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Tech startup Quark.ai uses deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to create highly accurate, automatic responses to customer emails and address any problems. What sets the company apart from similar ones is its recognition capabilities. For similar questions, the tech startup can identify the root of the questions asked and provides direct responses without the need for human interference or reference. Additionally, it can easily recognize duplicate emails and respond to one instead of both.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            For business owners, Quark.ai can be very effective for multiple reasons. In comparison to hiring a human who exclusively handles customer support, the company is a significantly cheaper alternative. Alongside being more efficient, the tech startup has been proven to be more efficient with its deep learning software only improving over time. 
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            One of the most important features that the company offers is document reading and processing. A business owner can essentially feed the deep learning software any documents or guides that relate to customer support or products being sold, and it will gain all relevant information to better respond to customers. 
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            The effectiveness of the software created by the tech startup has made it very popular with business owners looking to save money and increase productivity. Furthermore, many investors see the company as a major opportunity for future growth.
                        </p>
                      

                        <h2> Quark.ai Funding and Future Plans </h2>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            In a seed-plus funding round for Quark.ai, the business raised over $5 million. The funding round was led by DNX Ventures with participation from Fusion Fund, Tie Angels, and True Blue Partners. 
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            The company will use this new funding to help expand and improve the current technology used by the business. The technology will be scaled up to handle larger clients and more complex tasks. Additionally, the tech startup will look to grow its business by onboarding more customers. Earlier this month, the company was listed on the Zendesk marketplace to open itself to a larger audience. 
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Quark.ai is also gaining more momentum just as customer service sees its value rising exponentially. In fact, the customer service industry is worth well over $350 billion. That value is only expected to grow as more businesses begin to create an online presence for themselves. 
                        </p>

                            When commenting on the latest funding round for Quark.ai, DNX Ventures Managing Partner Q Motiwala said, “Quark.ai has already demonstrated unprecedented customer experience and efficiency to resolve complex support cases. We look forward to helping Quark.ai bring the power of the Autonomous Customer Support platform to enterprise customers throughout the world.”

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Quark.ai, the market leader in Autonomous Customer Support, today announced the introduction of its Autonomous Customer Support Chatbot, “Cory,” developed specifically to enable instant self-service resolutions for complex technical issues confronting industrial and technology enterprises.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                            Quark.ai’s interpretive and conversational chatbot delivers unsurpassed accuracy, reliability and speed-to-resolution for some of industry’s most mission-critical customer issues. The chatbot is an extension of Quark.ai’s Autonomous Customer Support platform, which combines Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to automate research-intensive functions that are often manual, expensive and frustratingly inefficient. Quark.ai promptly interprets complex Customer Support cases, scours an enterprise’s internal documents and delivers instant resolutions to customers. The result for Customer Support Organizations is significant improvement in Customer Satisfaction and support expense.

                        <br>
                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Existing Chatbots require pre-built rules and responses that address a narrowly defined set of inquiries, and thus are unable to handle the wide variety of issues that frequently confront technical support. Unlike these existing designs, Quark.ai’s Autonomous Chatbot is capable of having a conversation with the customer to resolve any issue or inquiry, without prior construction of the response. Quark.ai accomplishes this by using its proprietary NLP technology to clearly understand and cross-examine an inquiry, regardless of its complexity.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Quark.ai’s patented combination of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing produces a chatbot with the ability to ask-and-answer in more natural words, phrases and terminology maintains a more comfortable, insight-inducing conversation with a customer. This unrivaled solution considers, analyzes and contextualizes the different words that comprise the inquiry and applies that understanding to a resolution of the issue. It is capable of using all available documents within the organization to automatically and intelligently prepare responses and resolutions This unsurpassed capability is especially critical to customers of industrial and technology companies, whose complex products often have numerous versions and continual updates.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            “Quark.ai’s conversational chatbot fulfills the vision of self-service in customer support,” said Quark.ai Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Prosenjit Sen. “Nearly all inquiring customers who begin with self-service quickly abandon it in frustration and demand to interact with a customer support representative. This leads to a poor customer experience – and a sub-optimal resolution to the customer’s issue. Quark.ai’s conversational chatbot is a long-awaited solution to this pain point, injecting the accuracy, speed and comprehensiveness of Autonomous Customer Support to the front lines of customer interaction.”

                            <b> San Jose, CA, October 31, 2022 </b> – Quark.ai, the Autonomous Support Platform for Technical/Field Support and B2B e-Commerce, today introduced the Quark.ai Workflow Automator, a powerful module designed to power Field Support engineers with a self-service tool for rapidly resolving complex support-related workflow issues of industrial enterprises.

                            The Quark.ai Workflow Automator module enables unparalleled productivity improvement. A robust combination of Deep Learning, NLP and Computer Vision, it allows Field Support engineers to quickly and accurately troubleshoot issues in real time – whether at the customer’s site or remotely — with step-by-step instructions to help them identify and resolve complex issues. While troubleshooting, they can also ask Quark.ai detailed questions in natural English to see relevant sections of reference documents that have the answers. If Field Support engineers need help, they can also receive guidance from a back-office support staff who is also powered with Quark.ai’s tool.

                            “AI based workflows are critical for field support in telecommunication, heavy machinery, instrumentation and other industrial companies,” said Prosenjit Sen, Co-Founder and CEO of Quark.ai. “The Quark.ai Autonomous Support platform can optimize the resolution of customer issues by utilizing the Workflow Automator in combination with its companion Similar Tickets module. While companies often need to help Field Support engineers on-site, they frequently waste money by dispatching them when the issue doesn’t require it. Companies can solve this problem by additionally utilizing the Quark.ai Similar Tickets module, which can quickly identify other similar tickets from its historical tickets database. The Similar Tickets module illustrates previous actions taken in response to similar issues, enabling the company to maximize accuracy, speed and efficiency in resolving the new issue.”

Question: Is Preventive support available today?

                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            My Answer: In my opinion, we are not there yet but we are close. We started at Quark.ai about three years ago by providing an answer to a ticket. So the support engineer will open a ticket and will see the answer to the ticket on the right side of the screen. We called this Reactive Support. Today our Autonomous Support Platform can respond to many of the issues automatically. We call this Proactive Support. We are close to the days that we will be able to collect and process all sorts of data to prevent many issues from happening, therefore achieving Preventive Support. I always compare our journey to the Autonomous Vehicle, where today they are probably at phase 4 out of 6. I believe our industry is in phase 2 or 3 out of 6. With the progress in AI and the computing process, I envision that Preventive Support will be here within a few years for many cases.

                         – The range of embedded and custom touch points for the delivery of insight is increasing, serving multiple roles and use cases  <br>
– Insight engines continue to vary significantly in terms of ranges of prebuilt connectors, touch points, and integrations available  <br>

                            A lot has been said (and documented) about the importance of delivering an extraordinary customer experience. But there is one critical component to the puzzle often overlooked: the support agents’ onboarding process. Hiring the right people is essential, but a well-designed onboarding program will set them up for success for many years to come. Onboarding gets new employees through a time of uncertainty and can turn them into high-performing employees. The onboarding process for support agents lays the foundation for delivering a great customer experience. I can’t stress this enough; after all, the better informed or knowledgeable your agents are, the happier your customers will be.

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            The length of the training program and how many resources are invested in it depend on the business. Some products are more complicated and require more full-on training. For example, organizations with complicated products (high tech, industrials) or an extensive portfolio of products requiring individual training and familiarization on each one, will increase the amount of training. Ideally, most of the information a new hire will need to get up to speed on the solutions will be in a searchable and referenceable format. However, that is not the norm, and searching and finding direct information is not always easy with most organizations. Most agents end up reading documents where it will be just about impossible for them to retain the information.

                        <br>

                            Besides getting documentation in shape, some additional steps and considerations are usually part of an organization’s plan on onboarding. They all play a role, but there are some limitations to an individual’s capacity to learn and memorize that need to be addressed. Here are some key considerations.

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Almost all support organizations use peers on the support team to train new agents, essentially as support “buddies” or “mentors” to serve as primary contact points for the new agent or a combination of the two. It is helpful for a few reasons. First, it helps integrate the new person into the team. Secondly, it also shares the training work amongst several people, sharing the responsibility among team members and avoiding tying someone up for weeks during the onboarding of new agents. New people might also feel more comfortable asking their peers where to find specific information than asking their managers.       
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            However, it is crucial to consider that you’ll be pulling support agents away from their standard support duties, regardless of whether the training is being shared. Onboarding can decrease your team’s capacity for weeks until the new people are entirely up to speed. Many of the questions are usually associated with the products or solutions, so it would be nice to get those answers without interrupting others. Additionally, as questions come up from the new hires, you want to address them immediately and have them move on to the next thing, and that is hard since their peers may not be readily available, slowing down the process.

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Technical training ends up being a combination of

                        <ul class="quark_p">
                            <li>reading documents or manuals,  </li>
                            <li>learning from subject matter experts either through online capsules or live training (online or in the classroom),  </li>
                            <li> shadowing a team member as they handle cases, </li>
                            <li>and hands-on experience, where the new agent is handling some of the more uncomplicated cases.  </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Each of these options is great, but it is hard to retain everything learned. Our capacity to retain information is not unlimited, and regardless of which program or combination of programs are used, the retainment levels will be low. Humans forget approximately 50 percent of new information they encounter within an hour and an average of 70 percent within 24 hours, cognitive science expert Art Kohn has shown this through studies. After a week, that average goes up to 90 percent. This pattern is common to us all. It is known as the forgetting curve and was first presented by Hermann Ebbinghaus in his book on memory. However, the rate can vary by person and the presentable quality of the content, which considers factors such as memory strength, how meaningful the material is, and other physiological factors, such as stress. Thus it becomes vital to have a way for agents to go back and find information or answers that they may not remember.

                        The goal of onboarding is to move the agent towards being self-sufficient as quickly as possible, without overwhelming them or compromising the quality of customer care. Rather than throwing them directly into the deep end, slowly remove their training wheels as they become more confident with their knowledge. The speed at which an agent progresses through the onboarding depends on the product and their experience level. By gradually reducing the amount of oversight, the agent will feel confident as they develop a sense of the customer issues and tones, and begin getting greater exposure to more unique situations. However, to strike a perfect balance between time and knowledge is just about impossible. They almost need to have a virtual assistant or some other assistance they can always count on, when they are going through the onboarding and even as their roles progress past the onboarding phase.

                        <h3>Distributed teams (remote) </h3>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Transferring knowledge to a new agent is difficult enough when you’re face to face with them. It can be even more difficult when you’re working remotely. Remote onboarding brings a specific set of challenges. It can be challenging to get to know everyone on the team well enough to work effectively. If the employee hasn’t worked remotely before, they may feel isolated or cut off from their peers. Communication also becomes more difficult. Some things don’t translate well through text. New employees who are just learning to find relevant information might feel left out of the loop. With these challenges, it’s crucial to over-communicate and switch up the communication channel as often as possible. Sometimes a quick voice call can clear up a question faster than typing. However, all of these options require time, and it is even more time and effort than when employees are collocated. It is also amazing how employees don’t feel as comfortable reaching out through chat as they would when someone is sitting but a step away. These things inhibit the learning process.

                        <h3> Quark.ai approach to assisting on the onboarding and afterward</h3>
                        
                        <p class="quark_p">
                            Agent effectiveness and satisfaction are strongly linked with how foolproof your onboarding program is. Even with the considerations and approaches that we have described to help on the onboarding, there are still some limitations on how much the agent can retain or the amount of time that can be shared by peers/mentors or management. As a result, Quark.ai believes that as part of the process, there needs to be a way for agents to get immediate answers to their questions and issues, to build their knowledge, but not make it utterly dependent on memory. Our solution can do that because of our unique platform and advanced Deep Learning, NLP, and computer vision technologies. We have unique capabilities to revolve inquiries with answers from all available documents on the products or solutions. Our capability to understand the content within the documents is genuinely unique in the market. We can do that because our solution breaks down source documents into comprehensible logical segments. These segments can represent tables (understanding the information within the table) and any paragraphs associated with the table. The segments represent precise information that serves as answers to questions/inquiries that share a high correlation. We interpret complex and common inquiries using our advanced NLP. The description in the inquiries can be from a sentence to several sentences.   
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="quark_p">
                            The Quark.ai solution decreases the time required for training and learning the details of the products and services, especially in high-tech and other complex products/services, ultimately increasing the ramp to higher agent performances. Using the solution after onboarding, we can continue helping the agents perform at a higher level, above and beyond average expectations, because there will always be some holes in their knowledge of the solutions and services they represent. These performance improvements will have an appreciable impact on the organization’s ongoing resource costs and customer satisfaction scores (CSAT). Support agents that can provide customers with faster service and possess the knowledge to gain customer confidence will provide superior customer experiences. Additionally, agents performing better and having more success in their roles usually stay longer with the organizations, reducing hiring and onboarding costs.
